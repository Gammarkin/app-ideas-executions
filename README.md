# app-ideas-executions

---

# This is a repository wich contains my executions of the app ideias of the repository <a href="https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas" alt="app-ideas repo link"> app-ideias </a> by: florinpop17.
 * Most of the things are made in react. Some are made with class components, and others with functional components. (soon). I also Use Redux for state management when necessary, and Mantine for styles
## Demo <a href="https://gammarkin.github.io/app-ideas-executions/" target="_blank">Here!</a>. Just choose a tier, and if i've already made an app of that tier, it will be there.

## Each project has a tier, wich is distributed by folders. Each folder has its on projects, and all of them have a brief explanation of the projects in the README. The three tiers are:

| Tier | Developer Profile                                                                                                                                                |
